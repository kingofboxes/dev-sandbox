# dev-sandbox
Folder of random things I play around with for learning purposes.

## Current list of things in the sandbox.
- redis-cache: Fibonacci number calculator using Redis to cache the previously calculated numbers.
- auth-system: Dummy authentication system using bcrypt to hash user passwords and storing within Redis. Cookies are stored on the frontend using the cookie-parser middleware in Express to set the cookie when a user logs in. Fully functional React app made using create-react-app is contained in the 'frontend' folder, and the backend made using Express is contained in the 'backend' folder.
- csharp-leetcode: Git submodule which points towards my other repo. Contains solution files for some LeetCode questions, but is meant to be for C# and VS2019 practice.
